# Ram visualization window

This is a remake of "RAM" from Hacknet. There are some configuration values available in the source file.
Build it with `make build`.

The window will show a progressbar of occupied and active system memory. If text is enabled, two labels will be rendered: one indicating ram usage, the other indicating the number of active processes.
