# Trace animation

This is a remake of the famous Hacknet trace animation. Done with gtk2.0 and C. There are some commented configuration values in the source file.
Build it with `make build`.

You can configure the colors, fullscreen window geometry, timings, and line heights.
There is also a feature that allows you to run an arbitrary command using `int system(const char *command);`, when the animation is finished. (would make a nice shutdown animation, for example)
